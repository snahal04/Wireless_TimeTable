Sure, here is a summary of the time table I suggested, broken down by month:

Month 1:
- Focus on strengthening fundamentals of networking, including TCP/IP, OSI Model, and network protocols.
- Learn about wireless networking standards, including 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax and their differences.
- Study basic wireless concepts such as WLAN topology, site survey, and wireless security.

Month 2:
- Learn about wireless access points (APs), including their configuration, deployment, and management.
- Study WLAN architecture and design principles, including coverage area planning and interference management.
- Familiarize yourself with wireless LAN controllers and their role in managing WLANs.

Month 3:
- Focus on advanced WLAN topics, such as Quality of Service (QoS), roaming, and high-density WLANs.
- Study wireless LAN security and encryption protocols, including WEP, WPA, and WPA2.
- Learn about common WLAN troubleshooting techniques and tools.

Month 4:
- Review and reinforce previously learned concepts, focusing on any areas where you may need additional practice or study.
- Take practice exams and assess your readiness for industry certification exams.
- If you feel ready, schedule and take an industry certification exam in wireless networking.

It's important to keep in mind that everyone's learning pace and needs are different, and you may need to adjust this time table to suit your own schedule and learning style. Additionally, this time table is not meant to be prescriptive - you may find that you need more or less time for certain topics depending on your prior knowledge and experience.
